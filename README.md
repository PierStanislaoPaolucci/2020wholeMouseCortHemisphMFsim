# 2020WholeMouseCortHemisphMFsim

The code implements a mean field simulation reproducing the dynamics observed in a specific experimental recording.

The dataset is a whole (wild type) mouse hemisphere recording through optical imaging using GECI (genetically encoded calcium indicators). The mouse is anesthetized and the cortex displays the occurrence of slow waves. Data are provided from the LENS lab (Francesco Pavone).

## How to run

- Download the directory.
- Run "MFSimulation.ipynb" with the jupyter notebook.

## MOVIE

The movie "Movie_Inference_And_Simulation.mov" is a demonstration of the 2 steps inference and simulation procedure.
The inference performs a data-constrained optimization of the parameters of the mean field model.
The Mean Field simulation reproduces the dynamics observed in experiments.
