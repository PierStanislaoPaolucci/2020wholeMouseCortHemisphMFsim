# 2020WholeMouseCortHemisphMFsim

The code implements a mean field simulation reproducing the dynamics observed in a specific experimental recording.

The dataset is a whole (wild type) mouse hemisphere recording through optical imaging using GECI (genetically encoded calcium indicators). The mouse is anesthetized and the cortex displays the occurrence of slow waves. Data are provided from the LENS lab (Francesco Pavone).

## How to run
